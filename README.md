Yoinked directly from [AdventOfCode.com](https://adventofcode.com/about):
> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.


This repo thus contains the solutions I've authored for each of the daily challenges.
